    <p class="subtitle">How Jaja's Cup became your favorite neighborhood coffee shop</p>

    <div class="story-box">
        <strong>From a Dream to Your Cup</strong><br><br>
        Jaja's Cup began as a simple dream – to create a space where everyone could enjoy quality coffee without the pretentiousness or high prices of typical specialty cafes. Our founder, Maria "Jaja" Gonzalez, grew up in a family where coffee was more than just a drink; it was a way to connect, share stories, and build community. <br> <br>
        After years of working in corporate coffee chains, Maria realized that something was missing – the personal touch, the sense of belonging, and the commitment to making quality coffee accessible to all. In 2018, she decided to turn her vision into reality and opened the first Jaja's Cup in a small storefront with just four tables. <br> <br>
        Today, we still hold true to those original values: quality coffee, affordable prices, and a welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels like family.
